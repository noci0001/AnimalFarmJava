// 'All animals are equal. But some animals are more equal than others.'
// Mr Jones of Manor Farm is so lazy and drunken that one day he forgets to feed his livestock.
// The ensuing rebellion under the leadership of the pigs Napoleon and Snowball leads to the animals taking over the farm.
// Vowing to eliminate the terrible inequities of the farmyard, the renamed Animal Farm is organised to benefit all who walk on four legs.
// But as time passes, the ideals of the rebellion are corrupted, then forgotten. 
// And something new and unexpected emerges..

// Benjamin
